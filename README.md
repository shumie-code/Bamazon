# Bamazon
CLI application demonstrating the integrated use of SQL and Node.js server side technologies.

The Bamazon CLI app connects the javascript file Bamazon.js to the sql database file Bamazon.sql and integrates them in order to provide a command line shopping interface.

Leveraging the power of modularization in node.js, the server databases of mysql, and the functionality of javascript we are able to search for items by their respective ids and add items to our cart for purchase. If items are out we will be redirected to the inital prompt. 
This is done via the inquirer module. 
This application provides a customer read of products listed in the sql schema file.
